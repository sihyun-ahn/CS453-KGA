The provided output contains no `<strong>` or `<em>` tags, thus not complying with this aspect of the description.\n\n4. **Use of a `<blockquote>` tag**: There is no specific rule in the description regarding including a `<blockquote>` tag, so its presence does not necessarily indicate non-compliance. \n\nBased on the above points, the primary non-compliance stems from the absence of `<strong>` and `<em>` tags and the incorrect syntax of the second `<p>` tag.
