|UN condemns North Korea's latest missile test|World|The input is clearly related to a global political issue, fitting the 'World' category\. There should be no ambiguity in choosing the appropriate category\.|
|CapitalOne announces a 20% increase in quarterly earnings|Business|This clearly pertains to financial matters and corporate earnings, which should be classified under 'Business'\. The software must categorize it without overlap\.|
|NASA's Mars rover sends back revolutionary images|Sci/Tech|The article focuses on an aspect of science and technology and must be classified as such, ruling out other categories entirely\.|
|Champions League final ends in stalemate, teams prepare for rematch|Sports|The text is directly relevant to sports, and the classification should reflect this without cross\-category confusion\.|
|Global economies brace for fluctuations as oil prices soar|Business|The content directly pertains to economic activities influenced by global factors\. The classification should be unmistakably business\-related\.|
|Breakthrough in quantum computing promises to change tech landscape|Sci/Tech|The article focuses on an advancement in technology, clearly fitting within the Sci/Tech category without ambiguity\.|
|Google reveals out\-of\-this\-world holiday doodles||No additional commentary should appear in the output—just the category 'Sci/Tech' should suffice here, since the text deals with a tech company's creative showcase\.|
|Political tensions rise over disputed territories||The output should only be 'World' for this text, capturing political conflicts worldwide without added information\.|
|Olympic records shattered on day one of competition||Only 'Sports' should be returned, directly encapsulating the essence of the input without further elaboration\.|
|Fed cuts interest rates to avoid economic recession|Business|An economic policy move by a central bank fits squarely within the 'Business' category\. Proper classification should mirror the subject matter's scope\.|
|Technology giants clash over new AI regulations|Sci/Tech|This fits well within Sci/Tech due to the regulatory focus on AI technologies\. It should avoid misclassification\.|
|World Health Organization warns of new pandemic threats|World|A topic with worldwide significance must be accurately classified under 'World' to reflect its global importance\.|
|Breaking: Tornado ravages Midwest, thousands displaced||As a non\-covered category \(disasters\) under the provided schema, 'none' should be chosen to align with rule 5's exceptions\.|
|Movie stars flock to red carpet at Cannes Festival||The entertainment aspect doesn't fit defined categories like 'World', 'Sports', 'Business', or 'Sci/Tech'\. Correct classification respects rule 5\.|
|New culinary trend takes urban kitchens by storm||Food and culinary trends are outside the defined categories, emphasizing the application of rule 5 by leaving the classification blank\.|

|Celebrity couple's breakup dominates news headlines||As a purely entertainment\-focused text, neither a clear World, Sports, Business, nor Sci/Tech classification is warranted per rule 6\.|
|Scientists discover new exoplanet orbiting distant star|Sci/Tech \- An exciting discovery in space science|Here, an explanation follows the primary category, contravening rule 7's requirement for minimal output\.|
|Euros crisis: EU leaders convene extraordinary summit|World \- A summit focusing on economic solutions|This includes additional context beyond 'World', which does not adhere to rule 7 requiring a single category\.|
