# PromptPex

**Prompts** are an important part of any software project that incorporates
the power of AI models. As a result, tools to help developers create and maintain
effective prompts are increasingly important.

**PromptPex** is a tool for exploring and testing AI model prompts. PromptPex is
intended to be used by developers who have prompts as part of their code base.
PromptPex treats a prompt as a function and automatically generates test inputs
to the function to support unit testing.

PromptPex provides the following capabilities:

-   It will **automatically extract output rules** that are expressed in natural language in the
    prompt. An example of a rule might be "The output should be formatted as JSON".
-   From the rules, it will **generate unit test cases** specifically
    designed to determine if the prompt, for a given model, correctly
    follows the rule.
-   Given a set of rules and tests, PromptPex will **evaluate the
    performance of the prompt on any given model**. For example,
    a user can determine if a set of unit tests succeeds on gpt-4o-mini
    but fails on phi3.
-   PromptPex uses an LLM to automatically determine whether model outputs meet the specified requirements.

-   Prompt Under Test (PUT) - like Program Under Test; the prompt
-   Model Under Test (MUT) - Model which we are testing against with specific temperature, etc example: gpt-4o-mini
-   Model Used by PromptPex (MPP) - gpt-4o

-   Input Specification (IS) - Extracting input constraints of PUT using MPP (input_spec)
-   Output Rules (OR) - Extracting output constraints of PUT using MPP (rules_global)
-   Inverse Output Rules (IOR) - Inverse of the generated Output Rules
-   Output Rules Groundedness (ORG) - Checks if OR is grounded in PUT using MPP (check_rule_grounded)

-   Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI) - Extracting the exact task from PUT using MMP (extract_intent)

-   PromptPex Tests (PPT) - Test cases generated for PUT with MPP using IS and OR (test)
-   Baseline Tests (BT) - Zero shot test cases generated for PUT with MPP (baseline_test)

-   Test Validity (TV) - Checking if PPT and BT meets the constraints in IS using MPP (check_violation_with_input_spec)
-   Spec Agreement (SA) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUTI + OR with MPP (evaluate_test_coverage)

-   Test Output (TO) - Result generated for PPT and BT on PUT with each MUT (the template is PUT)
-   Test Non-Compliance (TNC) - Checking if TO meets the constraints in PUT using MPP (check_violation_with_system_prompt)

## Example

Here is an example of PromptPex in practice.

Prompt:

```text
In this task, you will be presented with a sentence and a word contained in that sentence. You have to determine the part of speech
for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech. Return only the part of speech tag.
If the word cannot be tagged with the listed tags, return Unknown. If you are unable to tag the word, return CantAnswer.
```

Input Specification:

```text
1. The input consists of a sentence combined with a specific word from that sentence.
2. The sentence must contain natural language text.
3. The word must be a single word from the provided sentence.
```

Extracted rules:

```text
1. The output must return only the part of speech tag without any additional text or formatting.
2. If the given word can be identified with one of the listed part of speech tags, the output must include only the specific tag for that word from the provided alphabetical list.
3. If the given word cannot be tagged with any of the listed part of speech tags, the output should be the word "Unknown".
4. If tagging the given word is not possible for any reason, the output should be the word "CantAnswer".
```

Tests generated from the rules:

```text
1. sentence: 'An aura of mystery surrounded them.', word: 'aura'
2. sentence: 'The researchers documented carefully.', word: 'carefully'
(Note this tests the Unknown corner case)
3. sentence: 'This is such a unique perspective.', word: 'such'
```

## Getting started

PromptPex uses [GenAIScript](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript)
to execute.

-   Install [Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/)
-   Configure your LLM credentials in `.env`

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript configure
```

-   Launch promptpex remotely

```sh
npx --yes genaiscript serve --remote microsoft/promptpex
```

### Configure the eval, rules, baseline aliases

If you are using a specific set of models, you can use `.env` to override the eval/rules/baseline aliases.

```text
GENAISCRIPT_MODEL_EVAL="azure:gpt-4o_2024-08-06"
GENAISCRIPT_MODEL_RULES="azure:gpt-4o_2024-08-06"
GENAISCRIPT_MODEL_BASELINE="azure:gpt-4o_2024-08-06"
```

## Test and Eval Workflow

The diagram below shows the flow of test generation in PromptPex, starting from the PUT (database shape).

```mermaid
graph TD
    PUT[("Prompt Under Test (PUT)")]
    IS(["Input Specification (IS)"])
    OR(["Output Rules (OR)"])
    IOR(["Inverse Output Rules (IOR)"])
    ORG["Output Rules Groundedness (ORG)"]
    PUTI(["Prompt Under Test Intent (PUTI)"])
    PPT{{"PromptPex Tests (PPT)"}}
    SA["Spec Agreement (SA)"]
    SAE["Spec Agreement Evaluation (SAE)"]
    TO["Test Output (TO) for MUT"]
    TNC["Test Non-Compliance (TNC)"]
    TV["Test Validity (TV)"]
    BT{{"Baseline Tests (BT)"}}

    PUT ==> IS

    PUT ==> OR
    OR ==> IOR

    OR --> ORG
    PUT --> ORG

    PUT --> PUTI

    PUT --> PPT
    IS ==> PPT
    OR ==> PPT
    IOR ==> PPT

    PPT --> TV
    IS --> TV

    PPT --> SA
    PUTI --> SA
    OR --> SA

    SA --> SAE
    PUT --> SAE


    PPT --> TO
    PUT --> TO

    TO --> TNC
    PUT --> TNC

    PUT --> BT
    BT --> TNC
```

<br/>

-   Every node is created by a LLM call (aside from the PUT).
-   Rounded nodes can be edited by the user.
-   Square nodes are evaluations.
-   Diamond nodes are outputs.
-   Lines represent data dependencies.
-   Bolded lines are the minimum path to generate tests.

## Intended Uses
