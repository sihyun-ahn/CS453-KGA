# PromptPex 

**Prompts** are an important part of any software project that incorporates
the power of AI models.  As a result, tools to help developers create and maintain 
effective prompts are increasingly important.

**PromptPex** is a tool for exploring and testing AI model prompts.  PromptPex is 
intended to be used by developers who have prompts as part of their code base.
PromptPex treats a prompt as a function and automatically generates test inputs
to the function to support unit testing.

PromptPex provides the following capabilities:
- It will **automatically extract rules** that are expressed in natural language in the
prompt.  An example of a rule might be "The output should be formatted as JSON".
- From the rules, it will **generate unit test cases** specifically 
designed to determine if the prompt, for a given model, correctly
follows the rule.
- Given a set of rules and tests, PromptPex will **evaluate the 
performance of the prompt on any given model**.  For example, 
a user can determine if a set of unit tests succeeds on gpt-4o-mini
but fails on phi3.

Here is an example of PromptPex in practice.

Prompt:

```text
You are given two items: 1) a sentence and 2) a word contained in that sentence.
You have to determine the part of speech for a given word and return just the tag for the word's part of speech.
Return only the part of speech tag.
If the input isn't a word, return Unknown.
```

Extracted rules:

```text
1. The output must be a valid part of speech tag in abbreviated form (such as ""NN"" for noun, ""VB"" for verb, etc.)
when the input word is identified as a known part of speech.
2. If the input word does not match the standard parts of speech, the output should be the string ""Unknown"".
3. The output must be a single word or abbreviation and should not include any additional text or formatting.
```

Tests generated from the rules:

```text
1. sentence: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', word: 'fox'
2. sentence: 'Quickly running towards success.', word: 'successful'
(Note this tests the Unknown corner case)
3. sentence: 'She sings beautifully.', word: 'sings'
```

## How to Use PromptPex

<img src="./images/promptpex-ui.png" alt="PromptPex UI" width="500">

PromptPex has a browser-hosted user experience that makes it easy to start using.  PromptPex is implemented with internal prompts that assume you can access gpt-4-turbo (defined in LLMFrontEnd.py).  As a user, you can use any model you have access to, including locally-hosted models, to run tests against.

## Getting Started 

> Use CodeSpaces / dev container to get a fully configured environment, including access to LLMs through GitHub Marketplace Models.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=microsoft/promptpex)

### Setup

- Install packages (pre-installed in Codespace)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### LLM configuration

#### GitHub Marketplace Models configuration

If you are using a Codespace and have access to [GitHub Marketplace Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models),
PromptPex will automatically use `gpt-4o` from the github marketplace.

#### Azure OpenAI + Microsoft Entra

- Configure Azure OpenAI end point key `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` in the `./.env` file 

```sh
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="api endpoint"
```

- Sign in with the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/). This is the recommended way to access your Azure OpenAI resource is to use Microsoft Entra ID.

```sh
az login
```

#### Azure OpenAI + Access token


Configure the end point `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and access token `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `./.env` file 

```sh
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="api endpoint"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
```

> :warning: **Important**: To ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys and endpoints, are not exposed in your repository, it is important to add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file. This will prevent the file from being tracked by Git and uploaded to the remote repository.

### Running local server

- Open a terminal and launch this command

```sh
cd app
streamlit run main.py &
```

## Using local models

If you want to leverage local LLMs,
you will need to install and launch Ollama.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
export OLLAMA_HOST="127.0.0.1:8502"
```

Launch the Ollama server

```sh
ollama serve & 
```

Only pull the model you want to run, these can fill up storage pretty quickly.

```sh
# ollama pull mistral:latest 
# ollama pull gemma2:9b
ollama pull gemma2:2b 
# ollama pull llama3.1:8b 
# ollama pull phi3:medium 
ollama pull phi3:mini 
# ollama pull gemma2:latest 
# ollama pull llama3.1:latest 
# ollama pull phi3:latest 
# ollama pull phi3:medium-128k
```

### Navigating the CLI

* `automatic_pipeline.py` is the main driver  
* It takes input as a prompt using `-i unix/path`  
* If the input file was `foo.txt` and you want to store the output in result dir, do the following:

```sh
python3 automatic_pipeline.py -i foo.txt -o result
```

It automatically creates the dir result/foo to save the result 
* All paths provided to CLI must be unix path, `use/forward/slash/path` and `\not\backward\slash`
* The most common use case is to run the whole pipeline, gen rules, tests and run tests:

```sh
python3 automatic_pipeline.py -i foo.txt -o result --run-tests
```

* To generate rules and exit, use `--gen-rules` and `--gen-tests` for generating tests and existing
* Gen rules `--gen-rules`, Gen tests `--gen-tests` and Run tests `--run-tests`
* `--use-existing-*` will use the old artifacts (rules and tests)

```sh
python3 automatic_pipeline.py -i foo.txt -o result --run-tests --use-existing-rules --use-existing-tests
```

This will run the existing tests without generating new rules and tests

```sh
python3 automatic_pipeline.py -i foo.txt -o result --gen-tests --use-existing-rules
```

This will generate new tests using the old rules.

`automatic_pipeline.py` implements the end to end automated prompt fixing pipeline. It takes a cli argument as the path to the prompt (in unix style, sample/prompt.txt).  
```py
python3 automatic_pipeline.py sample/LinuxTerminal.txt
```
The results goes into ap-results/ where variant-0.txt is the initial prompt with rules-0.txt as initial rules.
